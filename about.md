Hey! I'm Roman. I'm a 25-year-old physics student from Germany and I like cucumbers.

<!-- In my view, learning is as much about the expansion of knowledge as it is about daring to be imperfect and that's what this page is all about. I'd like to explore topics with a fresh mind, ask (stupid) questions and see where the path to the answer takes me. -->


If you want to keep it visible but commented, you can also use a block quote or other markdown formatting instead.
